selman konakçı has made technology an integral part of his life, constantly improving himself in it and cybersecurity. in his own words, he's a bit of a "nerd," but he's also a highly extraverted individual who enjoys connecting with others. exploring new technologies, experimenting with different solutions, and continuously learning are just everyday activities for him.

while his main hobby is diving deep into technical research and experimenting with new concepts, he also has an unexpected passion for magic tricks - though he enjoys the art of illusion and sleight of hand in his spare time.
