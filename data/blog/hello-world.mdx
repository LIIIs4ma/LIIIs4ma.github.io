### hello

this blog starts its journey into the world of cybersecurity by saying hello world. while i often focus on application security and devsecops processes, i also spend a lot of time delving into internal pentesting, active directory, exploit development and new research areas. i enjoy setting up labs to analyze results, and exploring sink & source points to gain a deeper perspective.

hereâ€™s a snapshot of what i plan to share:

- devsecops integrations
    - from conceptual ideals to practical outcomes
- bug bounty automations
    - streamlining vulnerability discovery
- cve analyses
    - deep dives into known vulnerabilities and their impact
- appsec explorations
    - research, sink & source analysis, hands-on results, exploring lesser-known topics
- pentesting
    - from reconnaissance to more advanced exploitation

let's set off by saying hello world and continue to learn and grow together.
